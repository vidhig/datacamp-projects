### Book Recommendations from Charles Darwin

> Build a book recommendation system using NLP and the text of books. 

This project involves treating texts as a **bag of words** and uses **TF-IDF** to get the vector representation of texts, following which distances between these representations are used to determine how similar or different the texts are.

### Predicting Credit Card Approvals

> Build a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved. 

This project involves using **logistic regression** to predict if credit card should be approved or not. It involves using **grid search cross validation** to tune the hyperparameters and choose the best performing model.

### Who's Tweeting? Trump or Trudeau?

> Build a machine learning classifier that knows whether President Trump or Prime Minister Trudeau is tweeting. 

This project involves using **multinomial naive bayes** and a **linear SVM** classifier on the **TF-IDF** representation of the tweets to predict whose tweet it is. **Confusion Matrix** is used to understand and evaluate the performance of these models.

### Find Movie Similarity from Plot Summaries

> Use NLP and clustering on movie plot summaries from IMDb and Wikipedia to quantify movie similarity.

This project involves using *kmeans* clustering on the *TF-IDF* representations of movie plot summaries to determine which movies are most similar.

### Word Frequency in Moby Dick

> Use web scraping and NLP to find the most frequent words in Herman Melville's novel, Moby Dick.

This project involves **web-scraping** the novel from Project Glutenberg and performing simple data processing and analysis on it to determine the most frequent words used in the novel.

### Extract Stock Sentiment from News Headlines

> Scrape news headlines for FB and TSLA then apply sentiment analysis to generate investment insight.

This project involves **web-scraping** news headlines for Facebook and Tesla from finviz.com and performing **VADER** sentiment analysis on them.

### The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning

> Use NLP on NIPS papers to uncover the trendiest topics in machine learning research.

This project involves using **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)** on **count frequency** representation of the titles of NIPS papers to determine what are the trendiest topics in machine learning these days.
